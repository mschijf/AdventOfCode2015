 * - you can find out that the first column in a row can be calculated by r(r+1)/2
 * - you can also see that the increment between two values in a row is always the same as the previous increment
 *   the same row, one column earlier
 * - and you can see the first incremnet (between the 0th and 1st valuein a row) is the same as row+1
 *
 * this can be formlaized in the formula that you can find under the name 'cantorIndex'
